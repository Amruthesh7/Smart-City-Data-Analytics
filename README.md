🚀 Project Overview

The Smart City Data Analytics Platform combines multiple urban datasets to create actionable insights.
It helps city planners, environmental analysts, and public safety officials understand the interplay between pollution, ICT, crime, and traffic congestion through interactive dashboards.

✨ Features

🌍 Air Quality Analysis – Trends of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂).

📡 ICT Infrastructure – Coverage of internet & adoption of smart devices.

🚔 Crime Data Analysis – Crime patterns by type, demographics, and time.

🚦 Traffic Analytics – Congestion levels in Bangalore, with temporal comparisons.

📊 Correlation Heatmaps – Identify inter-relationships across urban metrics.

💻 User-Friendly Interface – Flask-based web app with Plotly interactive visualizations.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Flask templates)

Data Storage: CSV datasets

📂 Data Sources

Air Quality Data – Pollutant levels across Indian cities.

Crime Data – Occurrence & demographics of reported crimes.

ICT Data – Internet & digital infrastructure metrics.

Traffic Data – Bangalore-specific congestion trends.
